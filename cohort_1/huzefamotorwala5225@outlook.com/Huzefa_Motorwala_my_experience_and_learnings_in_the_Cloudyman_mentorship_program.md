Today I learned:
1) what is cloud computing?
    cloud computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you       can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks
2) what is github and benefits of github
    GitHub hosts my source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to       every iteration and keeps me updated each time a developer makes changes to my program. When multiple people collaborate on a project,     it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by           keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make         your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.
3) concept of markdown language
    Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents
4) Importance of technical documentation
     Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a      product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on              something currently and  meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and      recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to            access information without chasing their managers
